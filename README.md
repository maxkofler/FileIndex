# FileIndex - a fast file indexing tool

**FileIndex is still work in progress and by no means stable, use it with care and feel free to report bugs and issues**

File system indexes do not have to be slow! Using the [NamesDB](https://github.com/maxkofler/NamesDB) submodule this file indexing tool achieves good performance. Once the filesystem has been indexed, its contents can be searched through blazingly fast, taking around 40ms to iterate over 1.5 Million filesystem entries. This performance will be improved as the development continues.
